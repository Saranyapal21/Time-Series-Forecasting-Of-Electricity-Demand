# Time-Series-Forecasting-Of-Electricity-Demand (ISI Kolkata Summer Internship)
In this project, we analysed the Electricity Consumption per Unit Capita(KWh) data which was obtained from the World Bank's official website. The data was available from 1971 upto 2014. The electricity consumption data thus, was a time series. 

At first, we analysed the data for trend, seasonality and other components. Then we went on with time series model fitting. We fitted a total of 3 different types of models namely ARIMA, simple exponential smoothing and Holt's method. Finally, we forecasted the electricity consumption based on these models.

We also plotted their time series plots and analysed the model errors (model diagnostics). Finally, we chose the best model among these three and estimated it's prediction error.
